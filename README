The input file should be formated as the following:

n h
x0 y0 a b c
...
n times
...

Where n is an integer that defines how many calculation will be made, h is a double and represent the stepsize, x0 and y0 are double that define the initial point and a,b,c are double constants from the function f(x,y) = dydx = a*x + b*y + c.

Example:

1 0.2
0.0 1.0 1.0 -2.0 4.0
